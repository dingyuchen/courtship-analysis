    # Cleaning the tracking data before detecting behavior

    **Cichlid behavior analysis · data-cleaning step · applies to every detector and feature**

    The lab pipeline turns video into tables of fish positions and fish pairs. Before any behavior can be
    detected, we checked those tables against the original video and found **three tracking artifacts that
    create fake fish pairs**, plus two issues that cleaning can't fix but that limit what the data can answer.

    Every frame below is real footage with the pipeline's skeletons drawn on top. Each skeleton is colored by
    track ID, a white ring marks the nose, and the label shows `ID <track ID> <sex label>`. The magenta line is
    the edge of the gravel floor.

    The rules live in one shared file, `circling_cleaning.py`, so every notebook and detector cleans the data the
    same way.

    ## Does cleaning remove real circling?

    Very little. During the human-labeled circling events the closest pair is almost always two real fish, so only
    about 5% of those frames lose their closest pair to cleaning, versus roughly half of the frames in the rest of the
    video. Cleaning removes fake pairs while leaving the behavior we want to detect almost untouched.

    # Limits of the cleaning rules

    The rules are simple proxies, so they make mistakes. The one we have seen: **a real fish past the floor outline
    gets dropped as a reflection.** The camera looks down at an angle, so a fish swimming high near the back wall can
    appear beyond the floor edge. The frames below show two real fish swimming in opposite directions along the wall,
    which a fish and its reflection never do, yet the upper one is flagged.

    How often this happens has not been measured. It barely matters for circling detection (the rule-based detector
    catches the same 15/15 labeled events with or without cleaning), but it would matter for per-fish counts or a
    model that relies on distance alone. **Possible fix:** only call an off-floor detection a reflection when a fish on
    the floor sits at its mirror position and moves with it.
